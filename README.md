The program implements an advertisement management program. It requires registration. Unregistered users can only access the registration or login menu. Placing or reading ads is possible only after registration. When registering you need to enter your name, username, password, date of birth, phone number and email address. The datas are stored in MySQL database. The users can change their data later. Registered users can either post or browse an ad. Advertisements include three categories, such as flats for sale, flats for rent, or looking for a flat mate.  Different ad types apply different advertisements.

In case of a flat for sale, in addition to the text of the advertisement, you must specify the following: when is the flat fit for occupation, whether there is a mortgage on the property, the target price, when was the block of flats built, where is the property located.

In case of a flat for rent the following details should be given in addition to the text of the advertisement:  where is the property located, how many monthly installments are requested, the monthly rent, the expected amount of overhead, is the flat smoking, or non-smoking, is it available for students, when is the flat fit for moving.

In case of a looking for a flat mate ad you must specify the following: where is the property located, how many monthly installments are requested,   the monthly rent, the expected amount of overhead, is the flat smoking, or non-smoking, is it available for students, how many people are currently living in the property, whether they are looking for a male or female flat mate, when is the flat fit for moving.

When placing a new ad, the program monitors, so that only the correct values can be entered in each field and handles any problems. All ads and users have an ID, and it is also possible to search among ads and users through the help of these IDs. However, anyone can browse the existing ads. The placers of the ads can modify or delete  their own ads. It is also possible for the users to delete themselves from the system.
